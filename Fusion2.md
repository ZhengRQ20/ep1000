**Knight Chess Piece Modelling using Fusion:**
<br>
To begin, I used the canvas function to create my base. A big tip for this step would be to trace out the canvas image, 
<br>
so adjusting the canvas opacity would help.

<br>
Alignment of the image is also pretty important.
<br>
With the specified dimensions in mind, I proceeded to create the intended layout.
<br>
The Arc tool  was a big help in this section.
<br>
Next came the conversion of the sketch into the base piece through the revolution tool.

<br>
After that I created a new sketch for the  Knight itself, following the previous steps.
<br>
Using the extrude tool, I managed to create the final model and render it.
<br>
However, my first attempt was a huge failure as I had neglected to check my settings.

<br>
Thus, I went to redo my sketch, but extra precision and care this time, and created my magnum opus!

<br>
I'll say I managed to make it look decently dignified for a knight.
