**Knight Chess Piece Modelling using Fusion:**

To begin, I used the canvas function to create my base. A big tip for this step would be to trace out the canvas image, so adjusting the canvas opacity would help.

Alignment of the image is also pretty important.

With the specified dimensions in mind, I proceeded to create the intended layout.

The Arc tool  was a big help in this section.

Next came the conversion of the sketch into the base piece through the revolution tool.

After that I created a new sketch for the  Knight itself, following the previous steps.

Using the extrude tool, I managed to create the final model and render it.

I'll say I managed to make it look decently dignified for a knight.
