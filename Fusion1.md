3. Start at the ORIGIN, draw the outline of the key tag using a rectangle.
4. Draw 2 circles to round off the rectangle.

7. Add your name, initials or identifying marks
8. Extrude the key tag to different thicknesses, you may want to experiment with this to get a good effect.

 I had some difficulties with getting an appropriate thickness for this step, but ended up with a decent one at the end.

 The final product managed to look pretty decent for my first attempt.
