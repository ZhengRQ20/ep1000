**Personal Keychain Modelling using Fusion:**

1. Create a new design file, save it.
2. Create a new component and begin sketching on the X-Y plane.
3. Start at the ORIGIN, draw the outline of the key tag using a rectangle.
4. Draw 2 circles to round off the rectangle.
<br />
A tip would be to always have keybinds one hand, such as 'm' for move and 'e' for extrude
<br>
Ensure that snap to grid is on for easier assembly.

5. Add the ring for the keyring on one of the ends.
6. Add an offset of 2 mm for the rim of the key tag

7. Add your name, initials or identifying marks
8. Extrude the key tag to different thicknesses, you may want to experiment with this to get a good effect.
<br />  
 I had some difficulties with getting an appropriate thickness for this step, but ended up with a decent one at the end.

9. Render/colour your key tag
10. Save and export the key tag design.

 The final product managed to look pretty decent for my first attempt.
